# French Flashcards — project context

A spaced-repetition flashcard app for learning French, built around one
person's year of handwritten class notebooks ("cahiers"). You upload a
notebook, Claude parses it into cards, and FSRS decides what you see and when.

Live at `french-flashcards-nine.vercel.app`. Repo `mlboryczka/french-flashcards`.

This document is written to bring a fresh session up to speed. It describes
what exists, why the non-obvious parts are the way they are, and what is
still open.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vite + React 18, no router, no CSS framework — styles are inline objects in a `S` / `T` theme constant |
| Scheduling | `ts-fsrs` 5.4.2 |
| Auth + data | Supabase (Postgres, magic-link email, RLS), free tier |
| AI | Anthropic SDK, model `claude-opus-5`, called only from serverless functions |
| Hosting | Vercel — `api/*.js` are serverless functions, auto-deploys on push to `main` |

**Free-tier gotcha:** Supabase pauses a project after ~7 days idle. When it
does, the app hangs on "Loading…" forever — `getSession()` never settles and
`App.jsx` has no timeout or `.catch()`. Resuming the project in the Supabase
dashboard fixes it. *Adding a timeout so this fails visibly instead of hanging
is still an open item.*

## How a session is built

`src/lib/sessionQueue.js` → `buildSession(cards, opts)`.

Selection is by priority, then **order is randomised**. Those are two separate
decisions and it matters:

1. **Lapses** — missed last time, due now
2. **Reviews** — due now, oldest-due first
3. **New** — never answered, capped at `newCap` (20)
4. **Spot-checks** — a random sample of mastered cards (stability ≥ 60d),
   ignoring due date; insurance against FSRS being over-confident

New and spot-check slots are **reserved before** the target is spent on due
work. Without that, a review backlog larger than the target starves new
material completely — with ~1,300 cards due and a target of 75, you would not
meet a new word for weeks.

The queue is then shuffled. Presenting fixed blocks (all lapses, then all
reviews) is *blocked practice*, which feels easier during the session and
tests worse afterwards. Mixing is *interleaved practice* — about g = 0.42 in
Brunmair & Richter's (2019) meta-analysis of 59 studies.

`applyAnswer(card, got)` maps the binary typed result onto two of FSRS's four
ratings — `Again` for a miss, `Good` for a hit. `Hard`/`Easy` exist for apps
where the user self-rates; here the typing check *is* the grade, and inventing
a confidence signal the user never gave would only feed FSRS noise.

### FSRS configuration (`src/lib/spacedRepetition.js`)

```
request_retention: 0.9      maximum_interval: 3650
enable_short_term: false    enable_fuzz: true
```

`enable_short_term: false` means FSRS never enters the Relearning state, so a
miss is recorded on the row as `last_answer_correct` instead. `sessionQueue`
reads that to find lapses.

## Card types: grammar / vocab / phrase

`src/lib/cardTypes.js` → `classifyCard(card)`.

Storage keeps four cahier category codes (`V`/`E`/`G`/`P` → vocab/expr/gram/
pron) because that is what the notebook sections are. Those are **not** the
distinction you study by, so the UI collapses them into three:

- **grammar** — `gram` or `pron` category, or a conjugation drill (front
  contains `→`, e.g. `aller (subjonctif) → ils/elles`)
- **vocab** — one word *or one concept*. `la patate douce` is a sweet potato,
  `le chemin de fer` is a railway: one thing to learn, however many words
  French spells it with. Determiners and compound-noun glue (`de`, `à`) don't
  count toward the size; gender pairs (`un vendeur / une vendeuse`,
  `gros, grosse`) are one headword
- **phrase** — an `expr` card of any length, or anything with a clause: a
  subject pronoun, or more than three real ideas strung together

Used for the **All / Grammar / Vocab / Phrases** filter in the Cards view, the
**By type** panel in Stats, and the tag on each card in Hardest Cards.

Note the filter exists by explicit user request. Studying one type at a time
is blocked practice and costs retention; the default is `All`.

## Card-quality machinery

Two distinct problems, two mechanisms. Both matter because a bad card is worse
than no card: FSRS records a recall that never happened.

### 1. English gloss on the French side

Cahier lines carry inline glosses and the parser sometimes left them on the
front: `je suis allé (I went (passé)` — the card answers itself.

`src/lib/cardText.js` → `cleanFrenchPrompt(fr, en)` strips a parenthetical
from the French side **only when it repeats a content word from the English
side**. Grammar tags — `(adj)`, `(f)`, `(pl)`, `(passé composé)` — are exempt.

Applied at **display time** (and to text-to-speech), so it fixes the existing
deck with no migration. The stored row and the answer side are untouched. The
same rule also runs over the parser's output so new uploads store clean.

### 2. One card teaching two different words

`les frais` is a plural noun (costs); `frais` is an adjective (fresh). Sharing
a spelling, they became one card backed by `the costs; the expenses; fresh`.
There is no single right answer to type, so it can't be studied or scheduled.

Three-step tool, profile menu → **Fix multi-sense cards**:

1. **Scan** — `src/lib/multiSense.js` runs over the whole deck in the browser,
   free. Shortlists on the deck's own separator conventions: a semicolon means
   senses got run together, so divergent parts suffice; a slash is the
   near-synonym marker (`to unload / to discharge`) and a short comma list is
   a gender pair, so those only count when the parts aren't even the same part
   of speech. Keeps the API bill to the real suspects, not all 8,700 cards.
2. **Check** — `POST /api/split-senses`, batches of 15. Claude decides
   split-or-keep and writes the correct front for each sense: the noun keeps
   its article (`les frais`), the adjective doesn't (`frais (adj)`), verbs go
   to the infinitive. Told to keep when unsure. Writes nothing.
3. **Apply** — every proposal is shown beside the card it replaces and can be
   unticked, then `POST /api/apply-splits` writes. The original row is
   rewritten as the first sense and **keeps its scheduling history**; the
   other senses become new cards starting fresh. Ownership is checked row by
   row; malformed splits are refused at both ends.

The parser prompt also forbids producing these in the first place.

## Serverless functions (`api/`)

| Route | Does |
|---|---|
| `parse-cahier.js` | Notebook text → cards. The big one: section slicing, homework stripping, slash-pair splitting, conjugation expansion, polysemy-aware dedupe |
| `chat.js` | Tutor chat. Proposes cards via a `propose_flashcards` tool; **never writes** — the client does the RLS-protected insert |
| `split-senses.js` | Audits candidate multi-sense cards. Read-only |
| `apply-splits.js` | Applies approved splits. Service role + manual ownership checks |
| `admin-update-card.js` | Single-card edit. Service role, because RLS was silently returning success with zero rows affected from the client |
| `review-answer.js` | Adjudicates "my answer should have been accepted" |
| `tts.js` / `pronounce.js` | French speech; `src/audio.js` falls back to the browser's own `speechSynthesis` when the backend is unreachable |
| `admin-users.js`, `parse-corrections.js`, `upload-batches.js`, `cahier-parse.js` | Admin and upload plumbing |

`api/_lib/` is skipped by Vercel's function discovery (underscore prefix), so
it is import-only.

**Environment:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`,
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`, plus `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` on the client.

## Migrations

Run in order in the Supabase SQL editor. `migration_006` is **schema only** and
`migration_007` holds all seeding — deliberately separated so re-running 006
can never undo 007.

- `005_spaced_repetition` — Leitner boxes (superseded)
- `006_fsrs` — adds `stability`, `difficulty`, `fsrs_state`, `reps`,
  `last_review`, `last_answer_correct`, plus a check constraint and two indexes
- `007_fsrs_reseed` — idempotent. Resets to New anything with `box <= 1 AND
  lapses = 0 AND NOT EXISTS (card_progress.seen > 0)`; re-seeds the rest from
  the box ladder or the `card_progress.score` ladder

**A cautionary tale worth knowing:** the first version of 006 treated the
`dates` array as review history. It isn't — those are the *lesson* dates a word
appeared on, so every parsed card has them and all 8,703 cards were marked as
reviewed. `isNewCard()` had the same bug, which meant the 20-new-per-session
cap had silently never applied. Production after the repair: 7,361 New /
1,342 Review.

## UI layout notes

These look arbitrary and are not:

- **`main` owns the reflow, not the shell.** Both side panels (tutor, feedback)
  push the content column via padding on `<main>`. Padding the shell shrank the
  **sidebar** too, jumping its account block up the page. The sidebar is not
  what either panel covers.
- **The feedback sheet is offset by `SIDEBAR_WIDTH`** so it centres over the
  content column instead of straddling the nav.
- **The card is height-driven, with a floor** — `height: 100%`, `min-height:
  170`, capped at 375, width following the 1.6:1 ratio. It used to be a fixed
  600×375, and once the window was shorter than that, centring overflowed in
  *both* directions and the top of the card rode up over the counter and the
  back button. The card area also uses `justify-content: safe center`, which
  falls back to top-alignment rather than overflowing upward.

  The `min-height` and the sizing below it were the *second* fix: height-driven
  with no floor meant the card absorbed the entire squeeze when a panel opened
  — at a 700px viewport it collapsed to 80×50 with its text still at 40px,
  while 130px of padding sat unused beneath it.
- **The card text sizes to the card**, not to the page. The card sets
  `container-type: size` and the text uses `clamp(19px, 10.7cqh, 40px)` — 40px
  at full size, scaling down with the card so a squeezed card is still legible
  rather than three enormous words.
- **`cardArea`'s 130px bottom padding is breathing room, not structure.** It
  drops to 16 whenever a panel is open, so the space below the card is given up
  before the card gives up anything.
- **The feedback sheet is capped at `min(340px, 40vh)`.** A flat 340 is nearly
  half the page on a laptop at browser zoom, and the study card pays for every
  pixel of it.
- **Tutor and feedback are mutually exclusive.** Opening one closes the other,
  routed through the feedback sheet's own close request so an unsent draft
  still prompts — and declining the prompt cancels opening the tutor rather
  than silently eating what you typed.
- **`ChatPanel` swallows the click that dismisses it** (otherwise it lands on
  the card underneath and flips it), but exempts real controls — that swallow
  was eating clicks on "Send feedback".
- **Nav markers use CSS longhands**, not the `borderRight` shorthand. React
  diffs per property, so a shorthand base plus a longhand override leaves a
  stale value when the item deactivates — both nav items showed a marker.

## Testing

`npm test` — see `tests/README.md`. Seven suites: two pure-logic, five driving
the real app in headless Chromium against a mock Supabase, asserting on
**measured** values (geometry, computed styles, request payloads) rather than
on intent.

If you change layout, measure it in a browser. Several bugs in this project's
history were "fixed" against an assumption and shipped broken. Two rules the
suite exists to enforce, both learned from checks that lied:

- **Write the assertion from the requirement, not the implementation.** A check
  derived from the code you just wrote can only confirm that code. This suite
  once asserted "the sidebar stops above the panel" and passed for weeks — the
  sidebar shrinking *was* the bug.
- **Never bake in a number describing fixture data.** Read it back from the
  fixture (`servedDeck()`). A hard-coded deck size went stale and reported a
  failure the app hadn't caused.

## Recent work (branch `claude/french-flashcards-troubleshooting-f1z8yn`)

Merged (PR #27 and earlier): FSRS migration, tutor chat panel, browser-speech
TTS fallback, back-button restoration, sidebar alignment, the card fitting the
window, the answer banner showing your own answer, tap-to-continue, French
gloss stripping, and the multi-sense cleanup tool.

Open in **PR #28**:

- Card fits the window instead of overlapping the counter and back button
- Result banner shows *your* answer, not a repeat of the correct one
- Tapping the card acts as **Continue** once the answer is showing
- French prompts have their English gloss stripped (existing deck included)
- Feedback panel: wider and capped at `min(340px, 40vh)`, closes on outside
  click, mutually exclusive with the tutor, and pushes only the main column —
  never the sidebar
- The card keeps a usable size and legible text with a panel open, at every
  window height
- Grammar / Vocab / Phrase classification, the Cards-view filter, and the
  By type panel in Stats
- The multi-sense card cleanup tool
- `npm test` — seven suites, in the repo

## Open items

- **The silent "Loading…" hang.** No timeout or `.catch()` in `App.jsx` around
  `getSession()`. When Supabase is paused the app hangs with no explanation.
  Offered several times, never picked up.
- **`create table user_cards` is missing from the setup SQL.** A fresh deploy
  following the README won't have the table.
- **Mobile / PWA.** Discussed, never started. The layout is responsive below
  720px but there is no install manifest or offline support.
- **The cleanup tool's Claude step has never run against the live deck.** The
  scan, review UI, apply path and write logic are all tested; what Claude
  actually proposes for real cards is unseen. Review before applying.
